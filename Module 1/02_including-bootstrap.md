# Including Bootstrap

Bootstrap is included in `index.html` with one CSS and one JS script. Ensure the following lines are present in your `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
<link
  href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>

<!-- Bootstrap JS -->
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

```

```
